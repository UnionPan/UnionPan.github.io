      <description>The dueling bandit problem natrually fits the description of a variety of recommendation systems that require learning on the fly&amp;quot;, yet have no explicit access to a reward&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; model. Instead, the ``human&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; part is</description>

      <description>We basically reviewed the techniques of proving the efficiency of Empirical Risk Minimization using local Rademacher complexity, and why it is not sufficient when the problem setting, and introduced a new assumption called small ball condition and its usage. Here are the slides.</description>

      <description>I remember having those unpleasant lines in our high school canteen, flooded by the starving students queeing for their lunch, I would always pick a window with fewer people waiting, compromising myself with awful food. Another similar thought that always stricked me was the odds that tourists always pick the same time to travel, there&amp;rsquo;s almost always traffic congestion everywhere during holiday seasons. Yeah, lives have been always so hard.</description>

      <description>We briefly reviewed the lower complexity bound of first-order convex optimization and how Nesterov proceed to match the lower bound using the estimation sequence, the slides are here.
Consider an unconstrained optimization problem: [ \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x) . ] Here, $f \in \mathcal{C}^1$ is a convex, $L$-Lipschitz smooth function. Everybody knows we can solve this problem by using first-order method.</description>

      <title>The Capacity of Deception</title>

      <description>Entropy and Optimal Coding Alice wants to communicate with Bob about a sequence of \(n\) independent random outcomes sampled from a known distribution \(Q\). They use binary code agreed in advance to limit the message length. The entropy of \(Q\) is the expected number of bits necessary per random variable using the optimal code as \(n\) goes to \(\infty\). The relative entropy between distributions $P$ and $Q$ can be interpreted as the price in terms of expected message length that Alice and Bob have to pay if they believe the random variables are sampled from $P$ when in fact they are sampled from $Q$.</description>

      <description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate from NYU Tandon. I am currently working on in statistical/reinforcement learning, game and control theory applied to urban/traffic control scenarios. This will be a cozy place where I share my thoughts not only some learning notes, but also about life and literature, history, even music and movies, anything interests me.
I would describe myself as a 6&#39;2.8&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; guard/small forward, (dunk occasionally.) Basketball is something I&amp;rsquo;ll never abandon.</description>
