      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would love to think of the ICML 2023 conference in Honolulu as a pivotal event for my P.h.D. research. During that time I was kind of talking to Reagan and having the time of my life. I remember in the conference there was a workshop session named &lt;em&gt;sampling over discrete space&lt;/em&gt;. It felt serendipitous, like the universe was pointing me toward somewhere significant, much like how my brilliant colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://taoli-nyu.github.io/&#34;&gt;Tao&lt;/a&gt; pointing to the bright future here haha&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past year I suffered a lot mentally and financially, my funding got paused and my girlfriend Sam (check out her &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/artist/3qo9BlnVduy6nW0pY1kmTQ&#34;&gt;spotify&lt;/a&gt;!) lost her boojee A.P.C. job. So I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s really a leisure and effort to write stuff consistently (because wtf am I supposed to write?!!?). But the coding agents (Claude, Gemini etc..) really revolutionarized my efficiency, and shamelessly I have to admit that I use them a lot to &amp;ldquo;vibe code&amp;rdquo; and even do research, with sufficient human surveillance.&#xA;So hopefully, I will resume writing for my own sanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
