      <description>In this post I just want to share a simple and elegant idea from a Control System Letter paper written by Maxim Raginsky et al.1. This idea largely inspired my recent work on multi-agent learning in (monotone) games2, which I might devote another post to talk about if I happen to get some interesting results out of it.&#xA;The idea starts from here: we all know that the archetype of solving convex optimization problem is through gradient descent: $$ x_{k+1} = x_k - \nabla f(x_k), $$ which, in continuous time, corresponds to an autonomous dynamical system: $$ \dot{x} = - \nabla f (x) , \quad x(0) = x_0.</description>

      <description>I did a presentation in a group meeting to briefly review the lower complexity bound of first-order convex optimization; and how Nesterov proceed to match the lower bound using the estimation sequence, the slides are here.&#xA;Consider an unconstrained optimization problem: $$ \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x) . $$ Here, \(f \in \mathcal{C}^1\) is a convex, $L$-Lipschitz smooth function. Obviously we can solve this problem by using first-order methods, using iterations:</description>
